# Waldbeere

JavaScript AB or Multivariate Test Runner

## Introduction

Waldbeere is a tiny JavaScript to run AB and Multivariate split tests.
Waldbeere is less than 1 <abbr title="Kilobytes">KB</abbr> large when gzip compressed and integrates with Google Analytics. Contrary to other AB and Multivariate test tools, Waldeere does not slow down your page -- there are no extra <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> or <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> requests.

### Advantages

* Supports both AB and Multivariate tests.
* Does not slow down websites.
* Free.

### Disadvantages

* No visual editor so you need to write the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> yourself.
* No data analysis -- you need to do statistical analysis yourself.
